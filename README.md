# dfcc - Dirt's Forth Chip Compiler

This project has three separate but related goals:

1. **To help a friend - or as close to a friend as we can be without having ever met in person. :D**  This is partly for `@Dirt2901` over on lunduke.locals.com.  This dude is building his own CPU, with a "classic mode" and a "Forth mode".  Yes, his CPU is using Forth as a low-level native instruction set!  That is so cool!  This is first and foremost a cross-compiler.  This way, he can compile code that runs on his chip as he builds and tests it.
2. **To help me in a few of my projects.** I'm building an 8-bit Forth.  I'm building an audio game system for Linux.  I'm building so many things that would benefit from a nice little VM that actually *interprets* the ISA of Dirt's Forth chip.  Even if things don't go all that great, I'm sure I can use the stuff I'm building here for my other projects.  Of course, for the purpose of this Git repo, the goal is eventually something that emulates his actual hardware - but for now, a little VM will have to do. :)
3. **To have some fun!** I've enjoyed creating stuff like this, for the purpose of creating stuff like this (lol).  Anyone who has seen my GitHub knows that.  Projects like this are generally more about the journey than the destination.  So it's nice to be able to play with it at my own pace, and enjoy the ride.  :)
